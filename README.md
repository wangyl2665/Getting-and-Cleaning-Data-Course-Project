## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### 1. Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . 

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

### 2. Raw Data process

process data as follow:

1. install package including readr, dplyr, tidyr by using install.packages()
2. Download the zip file from this URL, and then Uzip it.
3. Copy run_analysis.R to folder just created
4. Run run_analysis.R

output: tidy.csv

### 3. Other information

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the code book.
